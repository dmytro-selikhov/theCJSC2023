///////////////////////////////////////

// 🚨 The base URL of the API used throughout this section has changed

// It's not a big deal, it's really just one small change. Instead of:

// https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/

// It's now:
// https://restcountries.com/v2/

// So whenever we use the Countries API in this section, please just change the URL you see in the videos to this new one.

// Happy learning ✌️
